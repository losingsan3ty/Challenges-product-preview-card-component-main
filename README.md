## My process

1- Spent couple of minutes starring at the images seeing the details
2- added css filee and started adding general html
3-then I started to use css to replicate the images by switching back and forth until I reach a good result

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

The Major thing I learned was using html srcset property to use multiple images and the browser will pick the one fitting the prefred size which I can specify

### Continued development

What I am not comfortable with is general design is a something I need to really work on and I found this type of challenges really helpful to develop patterns I can follow in the future

### Useful resources

- [resource 1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39891785/how-to-display-different-images-in-mobile-and-desktop-devices) - This helped me to deal with multiple images using srcset property .
